The CELT library version 0.6.1 is used including git patch "0f0da999ae82a2b73974cc73a1a19d79a23ba8cd"
of celt.c by Jean-Marc "Better fading for PLC: no fading for the first loss, muting after 6".

Basically the files in celt-0.6.1/libcelt are used.

Changes made to libcelt to be compatible to llcon:

- replaced all "restricted" by "__restricted" and all "inline" by "__inline"


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attempt to use newer version failed due to the following reasons:

- Audio artifacts with high frequency sine waves is still present.
- PLC seems not to work better than the old version (maybe the integration in llcon
  was not correct and caused the behaviour).
- No bit stream compatibility to the old version of CELT previously used in llcon.

INTEGRATION ATTEMPT OF VERSION 0.11.1 -> LOG

The CELT library version 0.11.1 is used.

Basically the files in celt-0.11.1/libcelt are used.

NOTE That "static_modes_fixed.c", "dump_modes.c", "testcelt.c" must not be included in the project.

NOTE For debugging, the function "ec_bsr" must be removed in "ecintrin.h"

Changes made to libcelt to be compatible to llcon:

- replaced all "restricted" by "__restricted" and all "inline" by "__inline"

- moved static definitions of "eband5ms" and "band_allocation" from "modes.c" at the
  beginning of "static_modes_float.c"

INTEGRATION in the llcon software:
- celt_mode_create: The number of channels parameter must be removed
- celt_encoder_create -> celt_encoder_create_custom with additional parameter number of channels
- celt_decode: Additional parameter: frame size (always SYSTEM_FRAME_SIZE_SAMPLES for llcon)
- celt_encode: The NULL parmeter must be replaced by the frame size (always SYSTEM_FRAME_SIZE_SAMPLES for llcon)
- CUSTOM_MODES preprocessor macro must be defined
